/*

pthread_t is a data type used in POSIX threads (pthreads) to represent a thread.
When you create a thread using pthread_create(), it assigns a unique identifier
to that thread using a pthread_t variable.

*/

/*

The main() function makes sure that:

    All threads finish their work before main() exits.

    It doesnâ€™t exit too early, leaving unfinished threads running.

How Does It Do That?
By using pthread_join(), main() waits for the created threads to complete before it exits.
